# Hey, I'm Jacob 👋

Software developer, Rust enthusiast, toolchain obsessive. I build things at the
intersection of developer experience and systems programming — tools that are fast,
typed, and stay out of your way.

## What I'm working on

- **A typed scripting language** — Rust-powered, single binary, shell-first. Think Perl
  for the modern age, without the horrors. More soon.
- **[pkgx](https://pkgx.dev)** — the run-anything package manager, and
  **[tea.xyz](https://tea.xyz)** — open source funding infrastructure. Both shipping.

## Featured projects

| Project | What it is |
|---------|-----------|
| [gpg-inspector](https://github.com/jhheider/gpg-inspector) | TUI for inspecting GPG/OpenPGP packet structures. RFC 4880 + RFC 9580. |
| [semverator](https://github.com/jhheider/semverator) | Semantic version comparison and range resolution — CLI and Rust library. |

## Background

CS + Math, Masters in SE. Started writing code when programs were printed in the back
of magazines. Since then: network engineering, a couple of restaurants, some retail,
and a lot of open source. Opinions on type systems, strong preferences about toolchains.
