# Hey, I'm Jacob 👋

Software developer, Rust enthusiast, toolchain obsessive. I build things at the
intersection of developer experience and systems programming — tools that are fast,
typed, and stay out of your way.

## What I'm working on

- **A typed scripting language** — Rust-powered, single binary, shell-first. Think Perl
  for the modern age, without the horrors. More soon.
- **[tea.xyz](https://tea.xyz)** — open source funding infrastructure. Coming soon.

## Featured projects

| Project | What it is |
|---------|-----------|
| [gpg-inspector](https://github.com/jhheider/gpg-inspector) | TUI for inspecting GPG/OpenPGP packet structures. RFC 4880 + RFC 9580. |
| [semverator](https://github.com/jhheider/semverator) | Semantic version comparison and range resolution — CLI and Rust library. |

## Background

Previously at [pkgx](https://pkgx.dev) (the "run anything" package manager).
Before that: network engineering, a couple of restaurants, some retail. CS + Math,
Masters in SE. Started writing code when programs were printed in the back of
magazines.
